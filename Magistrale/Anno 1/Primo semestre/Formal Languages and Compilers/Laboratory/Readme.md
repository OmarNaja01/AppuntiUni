**Notice!**

- From A.A. 2024/25 (next year), the ACSE compiler will change. Thus, the tracks reported here might not be suited for the new compiler
- Even though the codes are written in C, for testing the solution is necessary to follow the guide the professor gave. The presented solutions are rewritten based
  on what the professors expect us to write at the exam
