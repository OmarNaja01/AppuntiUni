/*
The company TravelSpaces decides to help tourists visiting a city in 
finding places that can keep their luggage for some time. The 
company establishes agreements with small shops in various areas of 
the city and acts as a mediator between these shops and the tourists 
that need to leave their luggage in a safe place.

To this end, the company wants to build a system, called 
LuggageKeeper, that offers tourists the possibility to: look for luggage 
keepers in a certain area; reserve a place for the luggage in the 
selected place; pay for the service when they are at the luggage 
keeper; and, optionally, rate the luggage keeper at the end of the 
service.
